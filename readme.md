# Q-A

## 1
- `Q: What are important principles and considerations when working with a framework?`
- `A: Know core principles of framework  and have basic knowledge how to use that`

## 2
- `Q: Why is it important to separate code into distinct components?`
- `A: The goal of code splitting is not to split, but to separate. The idea is to create independent components, which does not require anything from each other, thus does need code from each other, thus require less code to ru`

## 3
- `Q: What is the proper balance between simplicity and performance?`
- `A: 50/50 on this, but generally depends on many factors - deadline, task, experience, etc.`

## 4
- `Q: Why is it important to reduce repetition in code?`
- `A: This not only reduces the length of your code, it makes it much easier to make wide-reaching changes on those parts of the code, since one change will take effect across the whole codebase, wherever that function is used.`

# 5
- `Q: Why is it important to follow standards?`
- `A: Implementing the code quality standards reduces many problems and the risk of project failures. If a code is complex, there are higher chances of it being vulnerable to errors. Coding standards help in the development of software programs that are less complex and thereby reduce the errors`

# 6
- `Q: What does abstraction mean in relation to writing code and maintaining code?`
- `A: In the process of abstraction, the programmer tries to ensure that the entity is named in a manner that will make sense and that it will have all the relevant aspects included and none of the extraneous ones`

# 7
- `Q: What is a healthy limit on the degree of abstraction used in the code, and why is that limit important?`
- `A: I think one dangerous aspect of abstraction is its ability to erase or hide the reality or the design it represents. You should always maintain a reasonable distance between what you represent and the representation. By "reasonable" I mean easily understandable by an external developer how hasn't been coding on this specific project.`

# 8
- `Q: What is the importance of consistency in code?`
- `A: Consistency is crucial when it comes to code quality because consistency leads to predictability. A solution with a high degree of quality will be predictable in the way it functions. You will be able to look at code, and without any domain knowledge, you should have a pretty good idea what's going on.`

# 9
- `Q: What are the pitfalls of dynamic typing?`
- `A: Run-time type errors. Can be very difficult or even practically impossible to achieve the same level of correctness and requires vastly more testing. No compiler-verified documentation.`
